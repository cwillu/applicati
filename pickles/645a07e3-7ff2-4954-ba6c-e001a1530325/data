VIn the world of the very small, there are some actions that don't accomplish anything.  Simple actions will ultimately put you back exactly where you started, and that even when you manage a net movement, you may end up dragging your environment along with you.\u000A\u000AAs people, the environment we deal with largely consists of people.  And what we accomplish is hugely affected by the people we surround ourselves with.  \u000A\u000AThe problem is that when we go looking for new people, we often end up dragging our environments along, for a distance.  Move less than that distance, and we haven't actually accomplished anything, beyond changing the scenery.  (No disrespect meant to changing scenery)\u000A\u000AJoin a club, and you still meet up with your friends afterwards to talk, and often some join with you.  Take a new class, you'll find many people you already know, and you'll probably still eat lunch with your friends.  Change divisions, reputations will follow; although you may see things from a different perspective, have you done much more than rearrange your environment?
